# story

It was a dark and stormy night. A person appeared out of the dark shadow showing only part of his face. As he crept out of the darkness, I could see his downward facing eyebrows and angry scowl... It was my dad. He was angry, because I had snuck out of the house so I could go hang out with my friends in the forest. But he didn't understand that this was an important meeting that I had to attend !!!! My friends wanted to make banana smoothies!!! I couldn't miss banana smoothies for anything! Not to mention worshipping the Great Satan and providing him with the flesh he so greatly desires. After all, our secret banana smoothie ingredient is skin shavings.

It was a dark and stormy night. A person appeared out of the dark shadow showing only part of his face. As he crept out of the darkness, I could see his downward facing eyebrows and angry scowl... It was my dad. He was angry, because I had snuck out of the house so I could go hang out with my friends in the forest. But he didn't understand that this was an important meeting that I had to attend !!!! My friends wanted to make banana smoothies!!! I couldn't miss banana smoothies for anything!
